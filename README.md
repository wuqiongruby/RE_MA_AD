# Random-effects meta-analysis of aggregate data on medical events

This repository contains the example code for the manuscript "Random-effects meta-analysis of aggregate data on medical events". 

The repository is divided by the two data applications used for analysis. Each directory contains the code for simulation study and real data application. We used Rstan to perform Bayesian analysis, therefore you will find R.files paired with stan.files for different parameter settings.
